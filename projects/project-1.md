Each day we have many unique experiences, and whether they be obviously life-changing or not, they shape who we are. Thousands of thoughts run across our mind, and as humans it's natural for us to try and express them in some way. Many turn to journaling as a a creative outlet or just a mechanism to process their experiences. The thing is, it's hard to keep up with on a daily basis - at least that is what I have heard from friends who have tried to do it, and if I'm being honest, I have failed at it too. It's easy to buy that cute statement journal - "1 prompt, every day for a year" or artsy leatherbound notebook, but the hard things is to actually write your thoughts in it everyday. In our increasingly digital world, many of us have left pen and paper behind, and as nice as it is to have a tangible journal, it doesn't always conveniently fit into the common person's daily life. Chrome-Reflect is meant to put an end to this gap in self-reflection. It is a Google Chrome "new-tab" extension, which means that whenever the user opens a new tab in their web browser Chrome-Reflect will be there to greet them and present them with a beautiful and easy-to-use interface for them to journal their thoughts as they flow in. Chrome-Reflect will always be their as you're surfing the web procrastinating on that paper, checking the morning headlines, or whatever else that thing called the internet is used for.
