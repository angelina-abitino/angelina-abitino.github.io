summary: During my spring semested of Junior year at Swarthmore College, I took a course called Design & Sculpture in the Digital Age cross-listed in the engineering and arts department. This extremely collaborative cross-disciplinary course taught me concepts of design as well as rapid prototyping. I became skilled with using the Adobe Suite, Rhino 3D modeling software, 3D printing, and laser cutting.
